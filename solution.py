## The Problem You'll Be Interviewing Someone On

Make a `solution.py` that solves the following problem: given a string representing a language (we'll plan for "english", "spanish", and "french"), print out a greeting for that language (in this case: "Hello!" and "Hola!" and "Bonjour!").

## Basic Run-Through

- Include some logic to choose from the right greeting based on that input.
- Print out that greeting!
